      <p class="lead font-weight-normal">The purpose of this product is to create a more secure way of entering a vehicle. By replacing
        the standard lock and key with a biometric security system that consists of a facial recognition software.
        The user will be able unlock the vehicle by log in to its web application by a smartphone or a computer.
      </p>
      <p class="lead font-weight-normal">
        In addition, the user interface will allow a user to register one or more people into a database by
        taking an image of the person's face. When using the smartphone's front-facing camera, the user's face
        will be compared to the registered facial images and determine whether the user has permission to
        unlock the door. The user will also have the option to grant or deny permission to people who have
        already been registered. The implementation of access permissions based on a database of biometric
        data will make life easier for the user because it will eliminate current features that can make accessing
        a car inconvenient.</p>
